AJAX editing 
===
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) editing is a quick and easy way to edit Midgard pages without 
need of changing the page. The intent of [AJAX][1] is to make web pages feel more responsive by exchanging 
small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, so that the entire web page does not have to be 
reloaded each time the user makes a change. This is meant to increase the web page's interactivity, speed, 
and usability. 

>Note: AJAX editing requires [JavaScript] [2] enabled browser. Recommendation is [Mozilla 
>Firefox][3] v1.5 or newer. 

If your web pages have AJAX enabled and you are using a modern browser, it is possible 
to see if the content is editable by hovering the mouse cursor on it. If the text under the mouse cursor turns 
yellow or there is a Double click to edit text, it means that it is possible to edit the text with AJAX. 


Simply double click on the text to enter AJAX editing mode. 
Note: Your web site might have customized names. Names change also depending on 
the used component. Consult your site manager if you are unsure of what to do. 

Depending on the configurations there can be many different objects to edit. They range 
from simple text fields to more complex fields, such as [TinyMCE content editor][4].

##Basic functionality

There are four different actions in AJAX editing mode 

1. Preview 
2. Save 
3. Cancel 
4. Delete 

###Preview 

Preview mode enables you to preview the page to evaluate if the page meets the requirements. 

It is possible to either 

1. Return to the editing mode or 
2. Save the page and to exit AJAX mode 

###Save 

When the content meets the requirements you may click on Save to save the edited content. When button Save 
has been clicked there will be an icon (see the picture) indicating the process. 

AJAX saves the page in the background. When the page has been successfully saved, there will appear a 
notification window indicating completion. This window will disappear automatically after a few seconds. 

###Cancel 

Clicking on cancel will discard all the changes made to the document and restore the original content. 

###Delete 

It is also possible to delete the currently edited page in AJAX editing mode. Click on Delete button to 
remove the current page. 

>Note: Delete button does not ask for a confirmation, do not click it unless you really want 
>to delete the page! 

##Composite editing 

Composites are a quick way of editing and adding content objects straight on the site layout. This is 
convenient especially for 'additional information' boxes and such items. 

###Using composites 

Composites are always site specific, even though they have some characteristical properties. Composites 
are always done using AJAX, which requires JavaScript.

>Note: If you are not sure whether your site uses composites, you can ask your site 
>manager for more information on the subject. 

###Adding an element 

There will be a button Create Composite item, where composites may be used. Note that names may and 
probably will differ, since composites are always customized for every site. 

1. Click on Create Composite item to create a new element
2. Fill in the information of the composite element 
* layout depends completely on the customized web page

3. Finally click on Save button to submit the 
information

###Editing and deleting an element 

 * Preview enables you to preview the page to evaluate if the page meets the requirements 
 * Save will save the edited content 
 * Cancel will restore the original element without overwriting 
 * Delete will remove the selected composite element 
 * Note that there will not be a confirmation, clicking on Delete will delete the item permanently. 

As with basic AJAX editing, it is possible to see if the content is editable by hovering the mouse cursor on it. 
If the text under the mouse cursor turns yellow or there is a Double click to edit text, it means that it is 
possible to edit the text with AJAX. 

1. Double click on the element you wish to edit 
2. Fill in and change the information according to your needs 
3. Click on the corresponding action (as described earlier in the beginning of this chapter)
