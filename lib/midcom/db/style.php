/**
 * MidCOM level replacement for the Midgard Style record with framework support.

 * The uplink is the owning Style.
 *
 * Note, as with all MidCOM DB layer objects, you should not use the get_by*
 * operations directly, instead, you have to use the constructor's $id parameter.
 *
 * Also, all QueryBuilder operations need to be done by the factory class
 * obtainable through the statically callable new_query_builder() DBA methods.
