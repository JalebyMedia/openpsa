/**
 * Baseclass to use for the component interface in MIDCOM.
 *
 * The class uses an event based approach for subclasses to influence the default behavior.
 *
 * The actual implementation should be enough for most smaller components, as
 * the classes behavior is widely configurable. You should not override any of
 * the base classes interface methods if you can avoid it. If you find that an
 * event handler is missing, please contact the MidCOM development team for
 * some advice.
 *
 * <b>Quick start</b>
 *
 * This class does a lot of things automatically for you, described below. If you
 * are not interested in the gory details though, here is a quick list of what
 * you have to know (but don't complain if I have missed anything), and do these
 * things after calling the base class constructor:
 *
 * - Inherit the class as {$component}_interface (e.g. net_nehmer_static_interface).
 * - Prepare a component manifest for your component, see the class
 *   midcom_core_manifest for details.
 * - You can change the values of all public members, the defaults should be suitable for cases.
 * - The component's data storage area will contain two keys when the initialized
 *   event handler is called: The NAP active id, defaulting to false and stored
 *   as <i>active_leaf</i> and the component's default configuration, stored as
 *   a midcom_helper_configuration object in the key <i>config</i>.
 * - Put your component wide default configuration into $component_dir/config/config.inc.
 *
 * <b>Class parameters</b>
 *
 * The following options can be used to parametrize the components startup and operation.
 * See the individual member documentation for now.
 *
 * - $_autoload_files
 * - $_autoload_libraries
 * - $_component
 * - $_nap_class_suffix
 * - $_site_class_suffix
 *
 * <b>Class operation</b>
 *
 * This class now does an awful lot of work for you, you just need to configure it
 * to have the right names and places to look for. It is designed to fit in the
 * current component wildlife with as little collateral damage as possible, but as
 * always, a 100% transparent implementation is both not wanted and not sensible.
 *
 * Actually, you should not need to overwrite any event handler for almost all components
 * I currently know of. Ultimately, this is a proxy class to the actual component code.
 * Its main goals are to automate these tasks:
 *
 * - Component startup (loading of the right script files and libraries)
 * - Default configuration (loading of the various configuration files, see the
 *   _load_configuration() method for details)
 * - Component data storage initialization
 * - Context separation during runtime
 *
 * <b>Example usage</b>
 *
 * The average component will require something like this, part one is the component
 * manifest:
 *
 * <code>
 * 'name' => 'net.nehmer.static',
 * 'purecode' => false,
 * 'version' => 1,
 * 'privileges' =>  Array
 * (
 *     'read' => MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW,
 *     'write' => Array (MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_DENY, MIDCOM_PRIVILEGE_ALLOW)
 * ),
 * 'class_mapping' => array('mgdschema_classname' => 'midcom_classname'),
 * </code>
 *
 * See the class midcom_core_manifest for further details.
 *
 * Built on this, we add the following interface class:
 *
 * <code>
 * class net_nehmer_static_interface extends midcom_baseclasses_components_interface
 * {
 *     function _on_reindex($topic, $config, &$indexer)
 *     {
 *         $qb = midcom::get('dbfactory')->new_query_builder('midcom_db_article');
 *         $qb->add_constraint('topic', '=', $topic->id);
 *         $result = $qb->execute();
 *
 *         if ($result === false)
 *         {
 *             debug_add("Could not query the articles for {$topic->id}, skipping indexing.");
 *         }
 *
 *         $datamanager = new midcom_helper_datamanager2_datamanager($config->get('schemadb'));
 *
 *         foreach ($articles as $article)
 *         {
 *             if (!$datamanager->autoset_storage($article))
 *             {
 *                 debug_add("Warning, failed to initialize datamanager2 for Article {$article->guid}. See Debug Log for details.", MIDCOM_LOG_WARN);
 *                 debug_print_r('Article dump:', $article);
 *                 continue;
 *             }
 *
 *             $document = $indexer->new_document($datamanager);
 *             $document->topic_guid = $topic->guid;
 *             $document->topic_url = $node[MIDCOM_NAV_FULLURL];
 *             $document->read_metadata_from_object($datamanager->storage->object);
 *             $document->component = $topic->component;
 *             $indexer->index($document);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }

     * leading slash must be returned (f.x. 'article/'), empty strings ('') are allowed
     * indicating root page access. If the GUID is invalid, null will be returned.

     * Be aware that this is the only event handler at this time which has a real default
     * implementation: If you do not override the base class implementation, it will iterate
     * through all NAP leaves applicable to the node associated with the topic. If a match
     * is found, its local URL will be returned. This will not be terribly efficient, so
     * you are strongly encouraged to have some more efficient solution instead. Obviously,
     * if you override the function, you shouldn't call the base class implementation unless
     * you really need it.
     *
     * @param midcom_db_topic $topic the Topic to look up.
     * @param midcom_helper_configuration $config The configuration used for the given topic.
     * @param string $guid The permalink GUID that should be looked up.
     * @return string The local URL (without leading slashes) or null on failure.
     * @deprecated Implement the midcom_services_permalinks_resolver interface instead
